# README: Setup

This directory should only be run once upon the download of this repo. Its 
purpose is to populate the necessary local database with information that 
doesn't require regular updates such as tickers and market history data.

Upon initial start, this will take multiple days to retrieve data. 

***Do not delete any files within this directory or it will trigger a re-download of all data as opposed to updating.***

## Special Thanks to:
[Benny-/Yahoo-ticker-symbol-downloader](https://github.com/Benny-/Yahoo-ticker-symbol-downloader) for providing information on tickers.
